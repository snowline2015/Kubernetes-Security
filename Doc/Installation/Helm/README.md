## Configure Kibana

### **Generate Kibana encryption key**

If you want to use the some features of Kibana, such as **Webhook** connector, you need to generate a new encryption key for Kibana. The provided ***kibana.yaml*** file already contains the ***encryptionKey*** parameter. You can generate a new encryption key for yourself by following the steps below.

First, you need to access the Kibana pod by running the following command:

```
kubectl exec -it {kibana-pod-name} -- bash
```

You can generate a new encryption key by running the following command:
    
```
bin/kibana-encryption-keys generate -f -q
```

```
helm uninstall kibana
kubectl delete configmap kibana-kibana-helm-scripts
kubectl delete serviceaccount pre-install-kibana-kibana
kubectl delete serviceaccount post-delete-kibana-kibana
kubectl delete roles pre-install-kibana-kibana
kubectl delete rolebindings pre-install-kibana-kibana

## Install K8s Agent

You can follow the instructions when adding Elastic Agent from Kubernetes integration in Kibana or using the existing manifest file to deploy the Elastic Agent.

Before deploying the K8s Agent, you need to edit the manifest file. There are 3 places that need to be modified:

* **host**: The host of ElasticSearch. The URL format is **https://{ElasticSearch_Service_IP}:{ElasticSearch_Port}**

* **ssl.verification_mode**: The verification mode of SSL.

> **Note**: If you are using default certificate that is generated by ElasticSearch, you need to set the value of ***ssl.verification_mode*** to ***none***.

* **password**: The password of the ***elastic*** user in ElasticSearch.

</p>

After editing the manifest file, you can deploy the K8s Agent by running the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f elastic-agent-standalone-kubernetes.yaml
```

> **Warning**: The provided manifest file is for example only. There is no guarantee that it will work properly in your environment. You need to follow the steps when adding Kubernetes integration in Kibana to generate the manifest file for your environment.
